# RINDEXER LOCAL CONFIGURATION - DEVELOPMENT MODE
# ============================================================================
# Used by: ./run.sh dev
# Purpose: Index auction events from local Anvil blockchain (chain_id: 31337)
# Mode: no-code (automatic table generation + webhook streams for business logic)

name: auction-local
description: "Indexes all events from Dutch auction contracts on local Anvil network"
project_type: no-code

# ============================================================================
# DATA ARCHITECTURE - TWO-LAYER APPROACH
# ============================================================================
# Layer 1: Rindexer Auto-Generated Tables (Raw Events)
#   - deployed_new_auction  ← DeployedNewAuction events
#   - auction_enabled       ← AuctionEnabled events  
#   - auction_disabled      ← AuctionDisabled events
#   - auction_kicked        ← AuctionKicked events
#   - auction_sale          ← AuctionSale events (individual takes)
#   - updated_starting_price ← UpdatedStartingPrice events
#
# Layer 2: Custom Business Logic Tables (via webhook → API → PostgreSQL)
#   - auction_parameters    ← Contract metadata cache
#   - auction_rounds        ← Processed rounds with incremental IDs
#   - auction_sales         ← Processed sales with calculations  
#   - tokens                ← Token metadata cache
#   - price_history         ← Time-series price data
#
# Why this approach?
# - Rindexer handles reliable blockchain indexing (hard part)
# - API handles business logic and data transformations (easy part)
# - Raw events preserved + processed data optimized for UI

# CONTRACT DEFINITIONS - LOCAL DEVELOPMENT
# ============================================================================
# NOTE: These contracts are deployed by ./run.sh dev automatically
# Factory address is set via environment variables from deployment script

contracts:
  # AuctionFactory contract - deploys new Auction instances (v0.1.0)
  - name: AuctionFactory
    abi: "./abis/AuctionFactory.json"
    details:
      - network: local

        include_events:

  # LegacyAuctionFactory contract - deploys legacy Auction instances (v0.0.1)
  - name: LegacyAuctionFactory

        start_block: ${LOCAL_LEGACY_START_BLOCK:-0}
        include_events:
          - DeployedNewAuction  # → deployed_new_auction table

  # ============================================================================
  # DYNAMIC AUCTION CONTRACT DISCOVERY
  # ============================================================================
  # This replaces the need for hardcoded Auction1, Auction2, Auction3 contracts!
  # Rindexer automatically discovers and indexes ALL auctions deployed by the factory
  
  # Modern Auction contracts (v0.1.0) - deployed by AuctionFactory
  - name: Auction
    abi: "./abis/Auction.json"
    details:
      - network: local
        factory:
          name: AuctionFactory                    # References factory above

        start_block: ${LOCAL_START_BLOCK:-0}
        include_events:
          - AuctionEnabled        # → auction_enabled table
          - AuctionDisabled       # → auction_disabled table  
          - AuctionKicked         # → auction_kicked table (round starts)
          - UpdatedStartingPrice  # → updated_starting_price table
          - UpdatedStepDecayRate  # → updated_step_decay_rate table

  # Legacy Auction contracts (v0.0.1) - deployed by LegacyAuctionFactory

    abi: "./abis/LegacyAuction.json"
    details:
      - network: local
        factory:

          - UpdatedStartingPrice  # → updated_starting_price table
          # Note: Legacy contracts don't have UpdatedStepDecayRate event

# Expected database tables (created automatically by Rindexer):
# - deployed_new_auction (factory events)
# - auction_enabled (token enabled for auction)
# - auction_disabled (token disabled)
# - auction_kicked (round kicked)
# - updated_starting_price (price updates)
# - updated_step_decay_rate (decay rate updates)

# All tables will include chain_id = 31337 for local Anvil network

# ============================================================================
# WEBHOOK STREAMS - CUSTOM BUSINESS LOGIC
# ============================================================================
# Purpose: Send events to API server for custom processing
# Flow: Rindexer → Webhook → FastAPI → Custom database tables
# 
# This is where auction_rounds, auction_sales, and other business logic
# tables get populated with calculated/derived data

streams:
  - name: business_logic_processor
    type: webhook
    url: "http://localhost:8000/webhook/process-event"
    events:
      - DeployedNewAuction    # → Creates auction_parameters entry
      - AuctionKicked         # → Creates auction_rounds entry with incremental ID
      - AuctionEnabled        # → Updates auction state
      - AuctionDisabled       # → Updates auction state
      - UpdatedStartingPrice  # → Updates auction_parameters
      - UpdatedStepDecayRate  # → Updates auction_parameters (new contracts only)

      chain_id: 31337         # Only process local Anvil events
